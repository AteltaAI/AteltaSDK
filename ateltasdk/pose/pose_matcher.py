    NOTE: Both angle_tracker1 and angle_tracker2 should be a matrix of size (n x 10) where n is the window size.
    taking n = 1 means the window size is 1 which is very instantaneous pose matching and considered as a static pose
    where taking a window size makes it more dynamic or more generalised.

        evaluation_threshold (float): The threshold for evaluating the match between both the poses
        use_procustes (Optional[bool], optional): Whether to use procuest. Defaults to False.

        Tuple[float, bool]: The ecludian distance as score and whether they are a match or not
